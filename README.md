# Hoover

### Approach
As I was not quite familiar with react, I decided to build the logic of the game in javaScript ([GitHub](https://github.com/Gia1987/Hoover-react/tree/master/Tech.js)) and tested with Jasmine framework, to have a big picture of the challenge.
Once finished the logic I started to adapt the logic to react. I also have to re-cover some react materials and learn them deeper.
I just managed to complete a few task like create a Grid and the possibility to change the size, I also wrote methods that allows to change the position of the Hoover. Hoover can move into the grid.

### TODO
Connect the logic to the Grid.
